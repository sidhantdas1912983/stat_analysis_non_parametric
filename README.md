The code performs friedman test, wilcoxon signed rank test and adjusts p value using benjamin hoceberg method.
Replace the array p with your set of p-values that you obtained after performing wilcoxon signed rank test.
Line 1 to line 18 of code are for my personal research use.
If you want to use benjamin hocberg on your data , execute from line 21 to line 47 and replace p matrix(containing pvalues) with your pvalues for the study.
